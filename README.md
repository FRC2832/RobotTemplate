This repository is designed to be a template library to start robot development with.  It also contains standard library functions the team has developed to help develop future robots.  It should always be updated to the latest WpiLib release.

Notes:
We require both Phoenix libraries 5 and 6 for the robot.  5 is needed for older CTRE device support like the TalonSrx module.
